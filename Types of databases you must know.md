| üîë **Key‚ÄìValue Store**          | Store data as key‚Äìvalue pairs for ultra-fast retrieval.                    | Extremely fast lookups; great for caching, sessions, and high-traffic APIs.                                         | Data Partitioning, Simple Data Model, High-Write & Query Performance, Developer Friendly | Redis, DynamoDB, Riak                  |
| üèõÔ∏è **Multimodel Database**     | Supports multiple models (document, graph, key-value, etc.) in one engine. | Reduces need for multiple DB systems; increases flexibility in architecture.                                        | | ArangoDB, OrientDB, Cosmos DB          |
| üìä **Columnar Database**        | Store data in columns instead of rows, optimized for analytics queries.    | Excellent for large-scale analytical workloads; faster aggregations.                                                | Column-Oriented Storage, Column-Wise Indexing, Analytical Query Performance, Column-level Compression, Scheme Evolution | Cassandra, HBase, ClickHouse           |
| üîç **Search Engine Database**   | Optimized for full-text search, indexing, and relevance ranking.           | Crucial for search-heavy applications; supports advanced text queries.                                              | | Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, Solr        |
| üåê **Graph Database**           | Store data as graphs, managing entities and relationships.                 | Best for relationship-heavy data like social networks or recommendations.                                           | Relationship Focus, Deep insight | Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, TigerGraph      |
| ‚è±Ô∏è **Time Series Database**     | Optimized for storing and querying time-stamped data.                      | Essential for monitoring, IoT, and time-based analytics.                                                            | Efficient Query Performance, Flexible Schema, Document Versiong | InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, QuestDB         |
| üß± **Object-Oriented Database** | Store data in the form of objects, as used in OOP.                         | Seamless integration with object-oriented languages; reduces impedance mismatch.                                    | Object Persistence, Object Versiong, Encapsulation & Data Abstraction, Inheritance & Polymorphism, Complex Data Models, Complex Querying & Navigation | ObjectDB, db4o                         |
| ‚ö° **In-Memory Database**        | Store data primarily in memory for lightning-fast retrieval.               | Ultra-low latency; ideal for real-time analytics and caching.                                                       | | Redis, SAP HANA, Memcached             |
| üß¨ **Vector Database**          | Designed to store, index, & search high-dimensional vectors efficiently.   | Powers AI applications like semantic search, recommendations, and embeddings.                                       | | FAISS, Milvus, Pinecone                |
| üì° **Spatial**          | Designed to store, manage, and query spatial or geographic data.   | Essential for applications like GIS, urban planning, resource management, and emergency response, allowing for complex spatial queries and analyses that traditional databases can't handle | Special Types & Indexing, Topology & Network Analysis, Column-Wise Indexing, Integration With GIS | Snowflake                |
| üìú **Ledger**          | Designed to provide an immutable and verifiable record of transactions over time | Ensure that every change to the data is recorded and cannot be tampered with, making them ideal for applications where data integrity and audibility are critical. | Transparency and Immutability, Auditability and Traceability, Consensus Mechanism | Amazon QLDB |
