# DynamoDB

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. As a key-value and document database, it is designed to handle large-scale, high-throughput applications. Here are some key features and characteristics of DynamoDB as a key-value database:

### Key Features

1. **Scalability**: DynamoDB automatically scales to accommodate your application's load. It can handle millions of requests per second and scale up and down based on demand without any manual intervention.

2. **Performance**: DynamoDB offers single-digit millisecond response times, making it suitable for applications requiring low latency.

3. **Fully Managed**: Being a fully managed service, DynamoDB handles tasks such as hardware provisioning, setup, configuration, replication, software patching, and cluster scaling.

4. **Key-Value Store**: In DynamoDB, data is stored as key-value pairs. Each item (record) is uniquely identified by a primary key, which can be a single attribute (partition key) or a combination of two attributes (partition key and sort key).

5. **Data Models**: In addition to the key-value model, DynamoDB supports document data models. This flexibility allows it to store and query complex data structures like JSON documents.

6. **Global Tables**: DynamoDB Global Tables provide a fully replicated, multi-region, multi-master database that ensures low-latency data access to users worldwide.

7. **Secondary Indexes**: DynamoDB supports both local secondary indexes (LSIs) and global secondary indexes (GSIs) to enable efficient querying on non-primary key attributes.

8. **Backup and Restore**: DynamoDB provides on-demand backup and restore capabilities, ensuring data protection and recovery.

9. **Streams**: DynamoDB Streams capture a time-ordered sequence of changes made to items in the table, which can be used for real-time processing or archiving.

10. **Security**: DynamoDB integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for fine-grained access control and supports encryption at rest and in transit.

### Usage Scenarios

- **Real-time applications**: Due to its low-latency responses, DynamoDB is suitable for gaming, IoT, and mobile applications.
- **E-commerce platforms**: Its scalability and high availability make it ideal for online retail applications.
- **Data lakes and analytics**: DynamoDB can be used to store and process large volumes of data for analytical applications.
- **Content management**: Its flexible data model supports the storage of various content types, making it useful for content management systems.

### Example of Key-Value Data

```json
{
  "CustomerId": "12345",
  "Name": "John Doe",
  "Email": "johndoe@example.com",
  "Address": {
    "Street": "123 Elm St",
    "City": "Anytown",
    "State": "CA",
    "ZipCode": "90210"
  }
}
```

In this example, "CustomerId" is the primary key, and the rest of the attributes represent the value associated with this key. DynamoDB allows you to perform operations such as `GetItem`, `PutItem`, `UpdateItem`, and `DeleteItem` on these key-value pairs.

DynamoDB's key-value nature, combined with its powerful features and seamless integration with other AWS services, makes it a versatile and robust choice for a wide range of applications.

## **Summary of the Paper: "Amazon DynamoDB: A Scalable, Predictably Performant, and Fully Managed NoSQL Database Service"** [[1]](./img/x/sahnlam/atc22-elhemali.pdf)

**Abstract:**
Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL cloud database service known for its consistent performance at any scale. The paper highlights DynamoDB's ability to handle large-scale operations, such as the 66-hour Amazon Prime Day shopping event in 2021, where it processed trillions of API calls with high availability and low latency. The service has evolved since its 2012 launch to address issues like fairness, traffic imbalance, and automated operations without compromising performance or availability.

**Introduction:**
DynamoDB is a foundational AWS service that supports high-traffic applications like Alexa and Amazon.com. It is designed for consistent low-latency performance at any scale, which is crucial for applications that depend on it. The service integrates six fundamental properties: fully managed, multi-tenant architecture, boundless scalability, predictable performance, high availability, and flexible use cases.

**Evolution and Challenges:**
The paper details DynamoDB's evolution from its predecessor Dynamo, which was a single-tenant system with operational complexities. DynamoDB combines the best aspects of Dynamo's scalability and performance with SimpleDB's ease of administration. The service's multi-tenant architecture ensures high resource utilization and cost savings for customers. DynamoDB also offers elastic table growth and predictable low-latency performance, making it suitable for diverse applications.

**Key Lessons Learned:**
1. Adapting to traffic patterns improves customer experience.
2. Continuous verification of data-at-rest enhances durability.
3. Maintaining high availability requires careful operational discipline and tooling.
4. Designing for predictability over absolute efficiency improves system stability.

**Architecture Overview:**
DynamoDB tables consist of items identified by a primary key. The architecture supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) through a simple API. The system uses a distributed data placement and request routing algorithm to maintain low-latency performance as tables grow. DynamoDB replicates data across multiple Availability Zones for high availability and durability, with optional geo-replication for global tables.

**Conclusion:**
The paper concludes by emphasizing DynamoDB's ability to provide a single-tenant experience in a multi-tenant architecture, meeting the needs of a wide range of customer workloads. The service's ongoing evolution focuses on maintaining its core properties of durability, availability, scalability, and predictable performance.

## Surprising to me: The storage node is B-tree based, not LSM tree - like I assumed for large scale NoSQL databases.

Yes, it's indeed interesting. While many NoSQL databases like Apache Cassandra and Google Bigtable use LSM (Log-Structured Merge) trees to handle large-scale write-intensive workloads efficiently, DynamoDB's choice of a B-tree-based storage node is notable. B-trees are typically favored for their performance in read-heavy workloads and their ability to maintain sorted data, which can be beneficial for range queries and ordered scans.

This design choice in DynamoDB likely reflects a balance between write performance, read efficiency, and the specific needs of DynamoDB's use cases. By leveraging B-trees, DynamoDB ensures consistent read performance and efficient data access patterns, which are crucial for the wide range of applications it supports.

## Solution overview

The reference solution uses a container-based Python application with a DynamoDB table as the data store. Along with Amazon ECS, the solution uses a combination of AWS services for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) for container registry, AWS AppConfig to host application configuration, and Amazon CloudWatch Logs to manage logs. AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) manages the network setup and Amazon Application Load Balancer (ALB) routes external traffic to the Amazon ECS service. The factors described in the next section provide details on how the different parts of the reference solution achieve the best practices recommended by the methodology. The high-level architecture of the reference solution is shown below.

### The twelve factors of the reference solution
- Backing services â€“ Your application must treat any service that it uses to perform its business function as an attached resource. This may be an RDS database, a DynamoDB table, an S3 bucket, or even a non-AWS service. The attached resource semantics prescribes that these resources are made available to the application as a configuration. Your application will be aware of the attached resource, but not be tightly coupled to it. For a DynamoDB table, it is sufficient to be aware of the table name, which is the resource identifier. In the reference solution, the name of the DynamoDB table comes from AppConfig, allowing you to switch out one table for another without any application downtime. This can be useful in scenarios where you are experimenting with different data sets to achieve A/B testing.
