## Distributed database

Apache Ignite is a distributed database, caching, and processing platform designed to handle high-performance, real-time data processing and analytics. Here are some of its primary uses:

1. **In-Memory Data Grid**: Provides high-speed, low-latency access to data by storing it in memory. This is useful for applications requiring fast data access and manipulation.

2. **Distributed SQL Database**: Supports ANSI SQL-99 for querying data distributed across a cluster, enabling efficient querying and data management.

3. **Persistence**: Offers native persistence, ensuring data durability. It can be used as a distributed database where data is stored both in memory and on disk, enabling faster read and write operations.

4. **Compute Grid**: Allows the execution of distributed computations, including parallel processing and map-reduce tasks, across the cluster. This is useful for computationally intensive tasks.

5. **Service Grid**: Manages and deploys microservices and other services across the cluster, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

6. **Streaming and Event Processing**: Supports the processing of large streams of data in real time, making it suitable for applications like real-time analytics and monitoring.

7. **Machine Learning**: Includes a set of machine learning algorithms that can be executed in a distributed manner, facilitating scalable and high-performance machine learning tasks.

Apache Ignite is often used in scenarios where high performance, scalability, and low latency are crucial, such as financial services, telecommunications, e-commerce, and other domains requiring real-time data processing and analytics.

## Compare it with redis

Apache Ignite and Redis are both popular in-memory data stores but serve different use cases and have distinct features. Here's a comparison between the two:

### Architecture and Deployment

- **Apache Ignite**:
  - **Distributed Database and Compute Grid**: Offers a comprehensive set of features including distributed caching, database, compute grid, and service grid.
  - **Hybrid Storage**: Combines in-memory computing with optional disk persistence.
  - **Cluster Management**: Provides advanced cluster management capabilities, supporting dynamic scaling and fault tolerance.

- **Redis**:
  - **In-Memory Data Store**: Primarily an in-memory key-value store known for its simplicity, speed, and support for various data structures.
  - **Persistence**: Supports both in-memory storage and disk persistence through RDB (snapshotting) and AOF (Append-Only File) mechanisms.
  - **Cluster and Replication**: Offers master-slave replication and Redis Cluster for sharding data across multiple nodes.

### Data Storage and Management

- **Apache Ignite**:
  - **SQL Support**: Full ANSI SQL-99 support, allowing complex queries over distributed data.
  - **ACID Transactions**: Supports full ACID transactions across the cluster.
  - **Data Structures**: Provides key-value, SQL, and native integration with Java, .NET, and C++ data structures.

- **Redis**:
  - **Data Structures**: Supports strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, and geospatial indexes.
  - **Limited SQL Support**: Does not support SQL queries; instead, it provides a set of simple commands for data manipulation.
  - **Transactions**: Provides basic transaction support with MULTI, EXEC, DISCARD, and WATCH commands but not full ACID compliance.

### Performance and Use Cases
