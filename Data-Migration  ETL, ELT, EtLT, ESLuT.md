# Data Engineering alphabet soup

## ETL, ELT, and EtLT

Are you confused by the Data Engineering alphabet soup? I've got you! Here is what you need to know about ETL, ELT, and EtLT!
------------------------------------------------------------
俱뫮잺 ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
What is it? - ETL is a data pipeline process where data is extracted from various sources, transformed into a format suitable for query and analysis, and then loaded into a destination database or data warehouse.
游릭Pros
- Data is cleansed and transformed before entering the warehouse, ensuring quality and consistency.
- Transformation outside the destination system can reduce the load on the data warehouse.
- Mature technology with many established tools and frameworks available.
游댮Cons
- Can be time-consuming as the transformation process must be completed before data loading.
- Less flexible to changes in transformation logic, as it requires modifications to the ETL process and data reprocessing.
- Can create bottlenecks, as data is unavailable until the entire ETL process is complete.

俱뫮잺 ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)
What is it? - ELT is a data pipeline process where data is extracted from the source systems and loaded into the destination system (like a data lake or warehouse). Transformations are performed within the destination system.
游릭Pros
- Faster loading times since data is transformed after it's loaded into the warehouse.
- Flexibility to change transformation logic as data is stored in its raw form.
- Takes advantage of the processing power of modern data warehouses and lakes.
游댮Cons
- A powerful data warehouse or lake is required to handle the transformation load.
- Potential security risks as raw, untransformed data is loaded into the warehouse.
- Can be more expensive due to the costs associated with high-performance computing resources.

俱뫮잺 EtLT (Extract, (small transform) Load and Transform)
What is it? - EtLT is a hybrid approach where data is extracted and loaded into a staging area within the data warehouse, and transformations are performed in multiple stages.
游릭Pros
- Offers flexibility in handling different data transformation requirements.
- Allows complex transformations to be broken down into more straightforward, manageable stages.
- Can provide a balance between performance and transformation complexity.
游댮Cons
- Can become complex to manage due to the multiple transformation stages.
- Coordinating the staging and transformation steps may require more design and maintenance effort.
- Could lead to longer data pipeline development cycles.

## ESLT (Extract, Sanity, Logic Unit in Memory and Transform)

Absolutely, let's refine the concept with your specific case, which we can refer to as ESLuT (Extract, Sanity, Logic Unit, and Transform):

俱뫮잺 ESLuT (Extract, Sanity, Logic Unit, and Transform)

What is it? - ESLuT is a specialized data pipeline approach tailored for scenarios where data integrity validation and consolidation across legacy systems are critical. It involves extracting data from various sources, performing a sanity check on frontier tables from legacy systems to ensure data integrity, utilizing a Logic Unit to consolidate data integrity within a customer hierarchy, and finally transforming the data for loading into the destination system.

游릭 Pros:
- **Enhanced Data Integrity**: The sanity check stage verifies the integrity of data received from legacy systems, ensuring only clean and valid data enters the transformation process, thereby improving overall data quality.
- **Consolidation of Data Integrity**: The Logic Unit consolidates data integrity checks across legacy systems, providing a comprehensive view of data consistency within a customer hierarchy.
- **Tailored Approach**: ESLuT is specifically designed for scenarios where data integrity validation and consolidation are paramount, offering a customized solution to address these specific requirements.
- **Real-time Transformation**: ESLuT can offer near-real-time processing capabilities, enabling timely insights and decision-making by transforming data within memory units.
- **Flexibility**: The Logic Unit allows for flexible and dynamic consolidation of data integrity rules, facilitating easier adaptation to evolving business requirements.

游댮 Cons:
- **Complexity**: Managing the Logic Unit and ensuring data consistency across legacy systems can add complexity to the data pipeline architecture, requiring careful design and maintenance.
- **Resource Requirements**: Implementing ESLuT may require additional resources for the Logic Unit and memory-intensive systems, potentially increasing infrastructure costs.
- **Skill Dependencies**: Developing and maintaining an ESLuT pipeline may require specialized skills in data integrity validation, legacy system integration, and real-time processing techniques, which may not be readily available in all teams.
- **Scalability Challenges**: ESLuT may face scalability challenges with very large datasets, especially when consolidating data integrity checks across numerous legacy systems within complex customer hierarchies.

Overall, ESLuT offers a tailored solution for ensuring data integrity and consolidation across legacy systems, but it comes with considerations regarding complexity, resource requirements, skill dependencies, and scalability challenges.
